<p class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><br>Enter the Rotherwas Room at Amherst College’s Mead Museum where you will find five monitor speakers, positioned on stands in a large oval configuration. Each speaker is dedicated to a single instrument, playing the second movement of Schubert’s cello quintet. This unique, 5-channel recording was created at the Sear Sound Studio in New York, produced by Alan Bise and photographed by Peter Neumann, for the Mead Sound Installation.<br><br>Explore this installation by moving among the speakers, listening to the work’s individual building blocks.. LIsten also to the instruments in pairs, three-at-a-time, or all together. 
For performers, the development of each chamber music performances begins with players at first most aware of what they will contribute individually to the whole. The rehearsal process melds the parts into a whole as decisions are made about how the single strands connect with each other. As concert-goers, we choose whether to concentrate on individual voices or the whole. We shape our experience in response to the decisions made by the musicians as well as by our own preferences. The sound installation provides a laboratory for us as listeners where we can experiment with a multiplicity of listening modes.<br><br>Enhancing the Sound Installation is the striking acoustic of the Rotherwas Room, a special wood-paneled room finished in 1611 and reassembled at Amherst in the 20th century. Visitors will be able to hear the Schubert Quintet second movement once an hour during the month-long installation.<br><br>Opens Tuesday, August 26th, 2014 and runs until Sunday, September 28th, 2014.<br><br>Check out more information on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amherst.edu/museums/mead">Mead Art Museum</a>.<br>
