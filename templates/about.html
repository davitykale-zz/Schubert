	<h2 class="col-sm-12">Why Live Recording?</h3>
</div>
<div class="row">
		<p class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
		When we think of live recording today, we might immediately think of YouTube videos with their immediacy and unedited content. For professional musicians, live recording carries a different meaning, namely, recordings that combine the precision possible in a studio recording with the spontaneity and energy of a concert recorded as it happens. Making a live recording requires: a) at least three concerts that include the targeted composition; b) a producer and recording engineer to record the concerts and to make small edits; c) a dedicated audience to provide the listening energy. Live recordings are prohibitive in the current market place. Presenters worry they cannot sell a series of concerts with the same works played.

	<h2 class="col-sm-12">Why Schubert?</h3>
</div>

		<p class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
	 	Schubert left us a wealth of remarkable compositions, including songs, string quartets, piano trios, symphonies, part songs, music for the church, a cello quintet, and much more. Whereas today there is no dispute regarding his stature as a first-rank composer, he faced profound professional struggles in Vienna as he navigated the changing economics of music and the towering reputations of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. That Schubert had to rely on freelance work and the kindness of his friends to support himself shaped not only his biographical journey but also his decisions about what kind of music to write and when. Only recently, with the groundbreaking work of the leading Schubert scholars, can we begin to understand this journey.

	<h2 class="col-sm-12">Why Cello Quintet?</h3>
</div>
<div class="row">
		<p class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
	 	Schubert’s last composition, his Cello Quintet (1828) scored for string quartet and second cello, ranks among the most admired of all chamber works. Its unique instrumentation presents a fascinating puzzle: why did the composer add a second cello, rather than the more expected additional viola as found in Mozart’s Quintets? Our Symposium will focus on why a second cello, while exploring aspects of Schubert’s career and final years. The Schubert Quintet will be performed along with newly transcribed string versions of an admired, yet virtually unheard repertoire of choral works central to the activities of Vienna’s private men’s singing associations. In addition, the long-forgotten George Onslow Cello Quintets will be performed and considered for their possible influence on Schubert’s compositional process. In the context of  the emerging role of music in Vienna’s public discourse: the composer succeeded with the Cello Quintet in elevating the string quartet genre from its more mundane role as “house music” to that of public music, thereby realizing his highest ambition--to Beethoven in posterity.
