				<h5 class="col-sm-4">Mark Steinberg (violin), Serena Canin (violin), Misha Amory (viola), Nina Maria Lee (cello)</h5>
				<p class="col-sm-12">The current project to record the Schubert Cello Quintet at Amherst College marks the Brentano Quartet's first live recording.<br><br>Within a few years of its formation, the Brentano Quartet garnered critical acclaim for its “passionate, uninhibited and spellbinding performances." Awarded the first Cleveland Quartet Award and the Naumburg Chamber Music Award, in 1996 the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center invited them to be the inaugural members of Chamber Music Society Two, a program which was to become a coveted distinction for chamber groups and individuals. The Quartet had its first European tour in 1997, and was honored in the U.K. with the Royal Philharmonic Award for Most Outstanding Debut. In recent seasons the Quartet has traveled widely, appearing all over the United States and Canada, in Europe, Japan and Australia. It has performed in the world’s most prestigious venues, including Carnegie Hall and Alice Tully Hall in New York; the Library of Congress in Washington; the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam; the Konzerthaus in Vienna; Suntory Hall in Tokyo; and the Sydney Opera House. Most recently, they have become the Quartet-in-Residence at the Yale School of Music.<br><br>An early champion of the Brentano Quartet, Jenny Kallick arranged for their residency at Amherst College as visiting Valentine Professors. Making frequent visits to the college, the Brentano Quartet coached student chamber music groups, performed on honors recitals, and played across the campus as ambassadors for classical music. The quartet has also played numerous times on the Music at Amherst Chamber Series, helping to build a strong and close relationship to the Music Department's regular concert attendees. This relationship is cherished by the Brentanos as well as our audience, creating the groundwork for the current live recording project.</p>

				<p class="col-sm-12">John Gingerich, together with Christopher Gibbs, will offer one of our keynote lectures during Saturday's symposium. John's detailed knowledge on Schubert's life and work during the years 1824-1828 will guide our understanding of the creation of the Cello Quintet, and its relation to Schubert's last works.<br><br>This lecture follows his presentation at the 2014 Bard Festival, <span class="italic">Schubert and His World</span>.<br><br>John Gingerich has published articles on Beethoven's late quartets and the concert series organized by the violinist Ignaz Schuppanzigh, on Schubert's cello quintet, on his Latin Masses and their reception, and on his "Unfinished" Symphony. His most recent work is a book, Schubert's Beethoven Project, published in 2014 by Cambridge University Press, and an essay, "'Those of us who found our life in art': The Second-Generation Romanticism of the Schubert-Schober Circle, 1820-1825," in the volume Schubert and His World published by Princeton University Press in conjunction with the Bard Festival 2014. He is currently working on a book on Ignaz Schuppanzigh. Before embarking on his musicology studies he spent several years playing in the cello section of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In his recent book, Gingerich provides a new understanding of Schubert's career and his relationship to Beethoven. Placing the genres and string quartet, symphony, and piano sonata within the cultural context of the 1820s, his book examines how Schubert was building on Beethoven's legacy. The author brings new understandings of how Schubert tried to shape his career to bare on new hermeneutic readings of the works from 1824 to 1828 that share musical and extra-musical preoccupations, centering on the "Death and the Maiden" Quartet and the Cello Quintet, as well as on analyses of Schubert's A minor Quartet, the Octet, and the great C Major Symphony.</p>
